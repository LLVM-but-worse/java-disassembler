    <b>Java Disassembler (JDA)</b> is a fork of Bytecode Viewer (BCV) that adds advanced code analysis features. The
    basic principles of BCV are maintained; however, many aspects are different.
</p>
<p>
    The main reason JDA was forked was that BCV was becoming too large and cumbersome, with many redundant, unused, or
    useless features. The issue with removing them is that there could be many BCV users that relied on such features.
    Because of this, it is more appropriate to fork JDA as a separate project. Additionally, BCV's development has
    stagnated, and the last official build is from July 2015. It has since grown increasingly difficult and arcane to
    compile BCV from source, and full jars often range into 20Mb in size. It has become necessary to fork BCV in order
    to make large-scale changes.
</p>
<p>
    With that in mind, JDA's goal is to be a light-weight yet powerful Java static disassembler. BCV suffered from a
    multitude of issues, but a large one was that it tried to be a dynamic reverse engineering tool (debugger) as well
    as a static tool (disassembler) at the same time, only succeeding partially in the latter. In the future, JDA will
    have powerful static analysis tools, such as control and data flow analysis, code contraction (copy and constant
    propagation), whole binary cross referencing (xrefs), and an IR engine. Additionally, many useless or irrelevant
    features have been removed. JDA's scope as a program currently is only to be a powerful Java disassembler and
    analyzer, not a debugger or unpacker.
